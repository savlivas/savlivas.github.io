        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Finland began as a province, and then grand duchy, under Sweden from
         12th to 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy under Russia
         after <time datetime="1809">1809</time>. It gained complete independece
         in <time datetime="1917">1917</time>, and successfully defended its independence
         during World War II with Germany.</p>

        <p>In the past 50 years, Finland has transformed from an agricultural economy to a
         more diverse industrial economy, lending to its per capita income becoming
         one of the highest in Western Europe.</p>

        <p>In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are high
         quality education, promotion of equality, and a national social welfare system. Its
         current challenges are an aging, older population and the fluctuations of an
         export-driven economy.</p>

        <!-- Location -->
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Finland lies within Northern Europe, bordered by the Baltic Sea, Gulf of
            Bothnia and Gulf of Finland. It borders Norway (709 <abbr title="kilometer">km</abbr>),
            Sweden (545 km) and Russia (1309 km).</p>

          <!--Climate and Terrain-->
          <h3>Climate and Terrain</h3>
          <p>Currently, Finland is the 66th largest country in the world. Its area is
            approximately the size of Montana, though slightly smaller.</p>

          <p>The terrain is relatively flat, with rolling plains and low hills littered
              with more than 60,000 freshwater lakes. Its major lakes, in order of size are:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Lake Saimaa (1,760 <abbr title = "square kilometer">sq km</abbr>)</li>
              <li>Lake Paijanne (1,090 sq km)</li>
              <li>Lake Inarijarvi (1,000 sq km)</li>
              <li>Lake Oulujarvi (900 sq km)</li>
              <li>Lake Pielinen (850 sq km)</li>
            </ol>

          <p>Finland has a primarily cold-temperate climate, and at times, approaching
            potential subarctic levels; much of Finland's northern regions are within
            the Arctic Circle. Otherwise, the country is considered fairly mild with
            the temperature moderation from the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic
            Current, and tens of thousands of inner lakes. Natural hazards are severe
            winter storms in the north.</p>

          <!--Population Distribution-->
          <h3>Population Distribution</h3>
          <p>Finland's total population is 5,587,442
            (<time datetime="2021-07">July 2021</time> <abbr title= "estimate">est</abbr>).</p>
          <p>The vast majority of the population is settled in southern Finland,
            concentrated on a small southwestern coastal plain. The northern interior
            areas remain sparsely populated.</p>

         <p>As of <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, women made up about 4% of the military's full-time personnel.</p>
         <p>After completing their initial conscript obligation, individuals enter
             the reserves and stay eligible for mobilization until the age of 50 for
             rank-and-file and 60 for non-commissioned and commissioned officers.</p>

         <!--Active Support Operations-->
         <h3>Active Support Operations</h3>
         <p>The Finnish Armed Forces closely cooperate with the militaries of other Nordic
          countries through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Defence_Cooperation">
          Nordic Defense Cooperation</a> (NORDEFCO),
          which consists of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden; these countries work within
          a voluntary participation model to cooperate in areas through armaments,
          education, human resources, training and exercises, and operations. This is
          not a military alliance.</p>

         <p>Finland is not a member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr>,
          but the two actively cooperate in peace-support operations, exercise together, and exchange analysis and information;
          Finland joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace program in 1994; Finnish Armed Forces
          participated in NATO-led military operations and missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan,
          and Iraq</p>

         <p>Finland is a signatory of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s
            Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and actively participates in CSDP
            crisis management missions and operations</p>
