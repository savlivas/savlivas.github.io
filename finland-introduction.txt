Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 
19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. 
It gained complete independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland successfully 
defended its independence through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent 
invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent 
half century, Finland transformed from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern 
industrial economy; per capita income is among the highest in Western Europe. 
A member of the EU since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro 
single currency at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features 
of Finland's modern welfare state are high quality education, promotion of equality, 
and a national social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging population and 
the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.
