   <h1> My 2022 Resolution - Complete Pokemon Card Organization (Sav Olivas)</h1>

   <!-- introduction -->

   <p>Given the recent boom in the Pokemon card economy, I figured I'd leaf through
   ten years' worth of my collection this year to complete a comprehensive
   catalogue of the ones I own. Ranging from 2002 (so far) to 2021, I approximate
   I have over 1,000 cards!</p>

   <h2> Current Work </h2>

   <p>As of <b>February 1st</b>, I have catalogued 116 Pokemon, and have finished the Kanto region
   of my collection (116/151 Kanto Pokemon). In total, I have sorted <b>280 individual cards.</b></p>

   <p> My rarest find is a <b>Machop</b> from the 2002 Legendary Collection. This card
     is a <b>Common (Reverse Holographic)</b>, and averages a $40 selling price on the online market.

   <h2> General Process </h2>
   <p>I've made two separate databases in Microsoft Excel. My primary
   catalogue consists of the cards sorted as they are in my binder-- Pokedex
   number. My secondary catalogue list focuses on each of the different
   collections that were released over the years; after categorizing each region
   in the primary log, I record the cards I have in each set in the secondary
   lists. This might seen confusing at first (especially without a visual guide),
   but I'll detail more below, and hopefully it'll make more sense.</p>

   <h3> The Primary Database </h3>
   <p>Using sites like PokemonTCG and cardmavin, I've sorted each individual card
   by its collection set number, year, artist and rarity. This is to take having
   multiple different cards for the same Pokemon into account.</p>

   <p>For example, in one row of a page in my binder, I have the following cards:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>#004	Charmander (1 card)</li>
     <li>#005 Charmeleon (2 cards)</li>
     <li>#006 Charizard (2 cards)</li>
   </ol>

   <p>Though it may look like an easy catalogue to make, there's more that goes into
   catagorizing different Pokemon cards. Here's an example of what these cards would look like in my primary database:</p>

        <td></td>

        <td></td>
       </tr>

      <tr>
        <td></td>

        <td>Platinum Supreme Victors (20/147)</td>
        <td>Rare</td>
        <td>Wataru Kawahara</td>
        <td>2009</td>

         <td>TOKIYA</td>
         <td>2013</td>
        </tr>
   </table>

   <p>Although I have two Charmeleon cards and two Charizard cards, they have different
   illustrations, rarities, and come from separate set releases. My two Charizards
   have to be treated as two separate cards, despite the fact they depict the same
   Pokemon.</p>

   <p>For some Pokemon, I might have more than 10 different cards, so I methodically
   log each one under these classifications to best display the full variety I own.
   After all, a collector of a certain set might just need a single card from my
   dozens of variants, and I should know whether I have that specific Pokemon from that specific set
   before cutting a deal.</p>

   <h3> The Secondary Database </h3>

   <p>This leads into my secondary database; a complete inventory of the cards I have for
every released set of Pokemon cards. This is only an easy feat after the initial
primary categorization -- 25 years of card releases is best tackled piece by piece.
For this set, I only begin marking down Pokemon cards after I've finished one Pokemon
region in the primary set; the Pokedex numbers serve as that designation.</p>

  <p>Below is an (abridged) version of my secondary catalogue, using the Platinum Arceus set.
  This set was released in November 2009 and contains 99 cards in the base set.</p>

    </tr>

  </table>

  <p> If you know anything about Pokemon, some of this might not seem right. None of these correspond
  to the individual Pokemon's official Pokedex number (Charmeleon is #005 in the Pokedex).
  Some evolutions are separated (i.e. Gastly and Haunter). This is because the (X/99) numbers correspond
  to the rarity of the cards, listed in alphabetical order. These cards are all in the 'Uncommon'
  rarity section. </p>

  <p> Though it might not look like I have many in this collection, it's likely I have
    cards from later generations to fill in those gaps! Time and effort will tell!</p>
