         <figcaption><p>The Finnish flag is white with a blue cross extending to the
           edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the
           left side in the style of the Danish flag; the blue
           represents the thousands of lakes scattered across the country, while
           the white is for the snow that blankets the land in winter.</p>
